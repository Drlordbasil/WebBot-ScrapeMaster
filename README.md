## Description
The **Autonomous Web Scraping Bot** project aims to develop a fully autonomous web scraping bot using Python. This bot will enable users to search for relevant information based on user-defined search queries and retrieve data from the web without manual intervention. It will utilize techniques such as web scraping, URL retrieval, parsing, and resource management to extract and store required data in a structured format. The bot will also handle errors and provide a user-friendly interface for search query input and data analysis.

## Key Features
1. **Search Query Processing:** The bot will interact with search engines' APIs using the requests library to retrieve search results based on user-defined queries. It will extract relevant URLs from the search results using web scraping techniques or APIs provided by search engines.

2. **Dynamic URL Retrieval and Parsing:** The bot will retrieve the relevant web pages' content dynamically, without hardcoding any URLs. It will utilize libraries like BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract the required information. The bot will also implement intelligent algorithms or machine learning models to identify and filter the most relevant information based on user-defined criteria.

3. **Autonomous Web Scraping:** A scraping module will be developed to extract data from web pages based on predefined patterns or rules. The bot will implement robust error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms to handle various types of web page structures and potential errors during the scraping process. Techniques like headless browsing or browser emulation will be used to handle JavaScript-driven web pages.

4. **Resource Management and Downloading:** The bot will manage and download any required resources dynamically, such as images, PDF files, or other media files. Python libraries like requests or urllib will be utilized to download the necessary resources from the web.

5. **Data Storage and Management:** The scraped data will be stored in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON, for further analysis or processing. Data management techniques will be implemented to handle large volumes of scraped data efficiently.

6. **Error Handling and Robustness:** The bot will handle various types of errors, such as connection issues, page not found errors, or CAPTCHA challenges. It will implement retry mechanisms and error logging to ensure smooth operation during the scraping process.

7. **User Interface and Reporting:** The project will include a user-friendly interface that allows users to define search queries and parameters easily. Clear and concise reports or visualizations of the scraped data will be provided for better understanding and analysis.

## Project Structure
The project's Python code is organized into several classes and modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the autonomous web scraping bot. Here is an overview of the main components:

- `SearchEngineAPI` (base class)
  - `GoogleSearchEngineAPI` (subclass)
  - `BingSearchEngineAPI` (subclass)

- `WebDataRetriever`
- `DataCollector`
- `ResourceManager`
- `DataStorageManager`
- `ErrorManager`
- `UserInterface`
- `ReportGenerator`
- `ProfitGenerator`
- `main`

## Installation
To use the Autonomous Web Scraping Bot project, performs the following steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd autonomous-web-scraping-bot
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the Autonomous Web Scraping Bot, the following steps can be followed:

1. Update the `main` function within `bot.py` file to customize the search engine and other parameters as required.

2. Run the `bot.py` file:
